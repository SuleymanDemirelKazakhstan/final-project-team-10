Week #1

This week our team finished developing and planning our idea. 
Now we are at the initial stage and are already slowly starting to develop a prototype of our service. 
In order for the work to take place in a comfortable environment, we have decided on the roles of each participant. 
Along with this, we think over the features of our service in order to distinguish ourselves from competitors (for example, a financial model). 
There is a lot of work ahead and we are sure that everything will work out.

Here is the prototype:
