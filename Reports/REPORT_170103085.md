## Plan:
1) Look at the existing models on the topic of image colorization and consider their performance
2) Identify the shortcomings of existing models
3) Read a research paper about technology that use pre-trained models
4) Find most suitable pre-trained models
5) Read research paper about self-attention GAN
6) Find most suitable metrics for image colorization
7) Try to fine-tune the existing model
8) Run Flask app for testing
9) Refactor the image conversion code for our API
10) Try to speedrun perfomance (Find a most suitable server platform with GPU)
11) Configure servers with Celery executor
12) Up docker-compose with Celery, Redis and Flask containers
13) Check docker-compose on capacity
14) Decide on what computational resources we will use our model (CPU or GPU)
15) Connect docker-compose with front servers
16) Check perfomance of microservice
17) Documentation
