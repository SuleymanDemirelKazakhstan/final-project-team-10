## Machine learning part:
Adilbek Karmanov and Maxim Kolesnikov
- Refactor the image conversion code for our API
- Docker
- Try to speedrun perfomance (Find a most suitable server platform with GPU)


## Frontend Part
Kirichenko Sergey
- Finilized UI
- Recompiled BASE64 converter, because of lack of memory. If image is too large (tested on 20mb Image) converter is dying and Angular starting reloading

Next step:
- Continue UI develop (modals, confirms, forms)



## Backend part:
Myrzabek Darkhan
- Removed REQUEST library because it is deprecated. Need to find new way for double-way transfering

Next step:
- Find new alternative library/develop own
