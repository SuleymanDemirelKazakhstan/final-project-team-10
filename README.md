## Non-functional requirements:
- The qualities of convertion must be good
- The application must have feedback part
- The application must be hosted on services with good GPU qualities
- The application must convert black-white to photos to colorized in 5 secs
- The application must be responsive (work well and look good on all screen sizes)
- The application must be able to support 100 simultaneous users
- The application must have electronic payment methods

## Risks:
- A trained model will not be able to show high results
- Convertion black-white videos may slow down website performance
- Our server GPUs will not be able to withstand the load of the site
